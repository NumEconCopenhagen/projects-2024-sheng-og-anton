**Introduction**
---
-	This project is about an Exchange economy, and it discovers and discusses different Walras equilibria based on various assumptions. 

**Purpose**
---
- The purpose of this Inaugural Project is to show that we can *structure* a code project on GitHub with the use of one notebook (inauguralproject.pynb), py-files, and good documentation.

**The structure of the assignment**
---
Our Inaugural Project is structured as follows:
1.	**[Introduction](inauguralproject.ipynb#introduction)**: At the start, we import the modules and classes, where we define the parameters, utility functions and demand functions. 
2.	**[Question 1](inauguralproject.ipynb#question1)**: We illustrate the set of pareto improvements in the Edgeworth box.
3.	**[Question 2](inauguralproject.ipynb#question2)**: We calculate the errors in the market clearing conditions.
4.	**[Question 3](inauguralproject.ipynb#question3)**: We find the market clearing price to be approximately 0.94.
5.	**[Question 4](inauguralproject.ipynb#question4)**: For question 4, we assume that consumer A choose her price to maximize her own utility.
a.	**[Question 4.a](inauguralproject.ipynb#question4a)**: We find the optimal price in the price vector to be , and the optimal allocation is.
b.	**[Question 4.b](inauguralproject.ipynb#question4b)**: We find that the optimal allocation to be: (x1A, x2A) = (0.621, 0.64), when no limits on the price.
6.	**[Question 5](inauguralproject.ipynb#question5)**: For question 5, we assume that consumer A is the market maker.
a.  **[Question 5.a](inauguralproject.ipynb#question5a)**: We find the optimal allocation: (x1A, x2A) = (0.56, 0.85) if the allocation is in the pareto improvements.
b.  **[Question 5.b](inauguralproject.ipynb#question5b)**: We find the optimal allocation (x1A, x2A) = (0.57, x2A = 0.84) under no further restrictions.
9.	**[Question 6](inauguralproject.ipynb#question6)**: We assume that an utilitarian social planner maximizes the aggregate utility.
a.  **[Question 6.a](inauguralproject.ipynb#question6a)**: We find the optimal allocation for consumer A: (x1A, x2A) = (0.33, 0.67)
b.  **[Question 6b](inauguralproject.ipynb#question6b)**: We compare the previous optimal allocations in question 3-question 6.a.
11.	**[Question 7](inauguralproject.ipynb#question7)**: We generate random endowments and plot them.
12.	**[Question 8](inauguralproject.ipynb#question8)**: We plot the market equilibria of the random endowments.  

The **results** of the project can be seen from running the notebook: [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** 
---

Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, this inagural project requires these following packages to run the notebook:
- **Matplotlib.pyplot**: We use Matplotlib.pyplot to plot some of the results in graphs.
- **Scipy**: We use Scipy to optimize some of the objective functions in the project (minimize and minimize scalar).
- **inaguralproject.py**: We use the inaguralproject.py-file to store the classes and the code.
