**Introduction**
---
-	This project is about an Exchange economy, and it discovers and discusses different Walras equilibria based on various assumptions. 

**Purpose**
---
- The purpose of this Inaugural Project is to show that we can *structure* a code project on GitHub with the use of one notebook (inauguralproject.pynb), py-files, and good documentation.

**The structure of the assignment**
---
Our Inaugural Project is structured as follows:
1.	At the start, we import the modules and classes, where we define the parameters, utility functions and demand functions. 
2.	**[Question 1](inauguralproject.ipynb#question1)**: We illustrate the set of pareto improvements in the Edgeworth box.
3.	**Question 2**: We calculate the error in the market clearing conditions.
4.	**Question 3**: We find the market clearing price to be approximately 0.93.
5.	**Question 4**: For question 4, we assume that consumer A choose her price to maximize her own utility.
a.	**Question 4.a**: We find the optimal price in the price vector to be , and the optimal allocation is.
b.	**Question 4.b**: We find that the optimal price, when no limits on the price 
6.	**Question 5**: 
7.	**Question 6**:
8.	**Question 7**:
9.	**Question 8**:

The **results** of the project can be seen from running the notebook: [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** 
---

Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, this inagural project requires these following packages to run the notebook:
- **Matplotlib.pyplot**: We use Matplotlib.pyplot to plot some of the results in graphs.
- **Scipy**: We use Scipy to optimize some of the objective functions in the project.
- **Pandas**: We use Pandas to manipulate the data.
- **inaguralproject.py**: We use the inaguralproject.py-file to store the classes
