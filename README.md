This repository contains the following

**[Inaugural Project - Optimal Allocations in the Exchange Economy](./inauguralproject)**
--- 
We solve the Exchange Economy, where we find the optimal allocations for consumer A based on different assumptions on the objective function and the ressource constraint.

**[Data Project - Exchange Rate Dynamics: The Relationship between Danish Inflation and Exchange Rates](./dataproject)** 
---
We fetch data from **Danmarks Statistik (Statistikbanken)** on **Exchange rates (EUR, USD, and CNY) in 100 DKK** and show that danish inflation rate does not put a pressure on the central currency parity, since it does not fluctuate by much and never outside the band of $\pm$ 2.25 percent. Moreover, we find the same result if we use the Eurozone inflation.

**[Model Project - Steady State in the Real Business Cycle Model](./modelproject)**
---
We numerically solve the simple Real Business Cycle Model (RBC-model), where technology, A, is exogenous and set to 1. Furthermore, we extend the model by using a CES production function instead of a Cobb-Douglas production function. The code of the equations in the system are inspired by Chad Fulton (2015) (https://github.com/ChadFulton/tsa-notebooks/blob/master/estimating_rbc.ipynb), however, we modify the technology equation and production function in the extension of the model. Lastly, we calibrate the model by analyzing how the steady state values change as a result of different parameter values.
